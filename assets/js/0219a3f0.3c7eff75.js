It now handles dependencies of packages that are [listed in package repository](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-package-repository/).\\n\\n## Handling dependencies\\n\\nWhenever the package manager installs a package, it checks, whether it has other packages that are required for it to function correctly. These packages are first searched in the local package list. If they are installed, the package manager proceeds to install the original package as normal. If a dependency is not installed, the package manager will first install the dependency, before proceeding with the actual requested package installation.\\n\\nThe package manager will also make sure, that dependencies are listed in the correct order. This makes sure that the initialization of a package is only attempted when all dependencies are already initialized. No more documenting \\"and make sure package A is above package B\\". This happens both after the installation and update of a package.\\n\\n## UI improvements\\n\\nThe UI also got some improvements. You can now show package details within the window, including version, description, dependencies and a link to the website.\\n\\n![package detail view](2023_04_24_files/detail_page.png)\\n\\nThe UI main page got some layout imprvements by using icons instead of text for buttons, which makes the page much cleaner.\\n\\n![package list view](2023_04_24_files/package_listing.png)\\n\\n## Closing words\\n\\nIf these features got you interested, please feel free to either [open an issue about including your package](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-package-repository/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+package&template=new_package.yml&title=%5BPackage%5D%3A+) in the package listing or contact me on the Achaea or Nexus discrod if you need more information.

To avoid accidental overwriting of existing callbacks, especially between different users of the EventBus, duplicate subscription names generate an error. So you may want to namespace your event names.\\n\\nYou can now access the list of subscribers to an event using the `getSubscribers` method. This allows easy inspection of the subscription state of callbacks. The subscribers may not be changed this way."}]}')}}]);
