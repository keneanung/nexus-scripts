However, structuring them in a way that is logical and that makes the global\\n`nexusclient` object available, is hard 8for me). TypeScript by default supports Module syntaxes only. After some trial and error, I found a way to support both the monorepo usecase of this repository\\nas well as consuming the types in an external project like [nssc](https://keneanung.github.io/nssc/).\\n\\n## What\'s Breaking?\\n\\nDue to the restructuring, types for the different Nexus objects like Reflexes, Actions and so on now need to be imported like normal classes (eg. `import {Reflex} from \'@keneanung/irong-realms-nexus-typings\'`)\\ninstead of using the `nexusclient` namespace. Functions like `ui()` or `send_commands()` on the namespace still work by siply using the namespace without any imports: `nexusclient.send_commands()`.\\n\\nIf you like the project, please consider leaving a star on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts) and [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/keneanung)."},{"id":"/2023/07/04/_Breaking_the_UI","metadata":{"permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/07/04/_Breaking_the_UI","editUrl":"https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/edit/development/website/blog/blog/2023-07-04_Breaking_the_UI.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-04_Breaking_the_UI.md","title":"Breaking the UI","description":"Howdy!

It tracks the queue, allows you to queue client-side commands and tries to integrate as seamlessly as possible with external queue sources.\\n\\nThis release does not allow for the foll flexibility of the in-game queueing yet (like prepending or adding at certain places in the queue), but it should be enough to vet the implementation. For more details, please refer to [the documentation](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-scripts/docs/queue-manager/).\\n\\n## Developer Documentation\\n\\nDue to the switch to the monorepo structure, I added a lot of additional developer documentation, like READMEs, [a Code of Conduct](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please have a look!\\n\\n## More Infrastructure Changes\\n\\nIn addition to the overall layout change of the repository and all linked changes, I also switch from dependabot to [renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/). This hopefully further decreases the dependency maintenance burden as dependency upgrades are now bundled together. Currently, this still has some kinks to straighten out, but I\'m sure we will get there.\\n\\n## Other Changes\\n\\nMost packages should now export their classes as a global library, which webpack then can use to avoid bundling all the code with yours. This is still untested, so expect further changes in that area.\\n\\nAdditionally, quite a few of the linter and test rules saw some harmonization, which prompted a few non-code changes to follow best practices.\\n\\nIf you like the project, please consider leaving a star on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts) and [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/keneanung)."},{"id":"/2023/06/23/_a_new_home","metadata":{"permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/06/23/_a_new_home","editUrl":"https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/edit/development/website/blog/blog/2023-06-23_a_new_home.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-23_a_new_home.md","title":"A New Home for my Nexus Repositories","description":"Man tapping microphone","date":"2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 23, 2023","tags":[{"label":"blog-entry","permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/tags/blog-entry"}],"readingTime":2.725,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"keneanung","url":"https://github.com/keneanung","email":"keneanung@gmail.com","key":"keneanung"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"keneanung","tags":["blog-entry"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Queues!","permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/06/26/_Queues"},"nextItem":{"title":"Nexus Package Manager v0.2.1 & v0.2.2: Bugfix for Disappearing Actions","permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/06/05/_disappearing_actions"}},"content":"![Man tapping microphone](https://media.giphy.com/media/B4xdycvhDq7qM3cdh2/giphy.gif)\\n\\nTest, test... Is this thing on? Aehm...\\n\\nSince the infrastructure seems to be up and running, it is time to tell you why we moved.\\n\\n## Why I Combined Multiple Independent Repositories into a Monorepo for Enhanced Script Management\\n\\nToday, I want to share my personal journey of merging multiple independent repositories into a monorepo for better script management. It\'s not about convincing you that monorepos are the holy grail, but rather about sharing why I made this decision and the benefits I experienced. So, let\'s dive in!\\n\\n### Tired of Update Chaos\\n\\nI used to manage my scripts across different repositories. Every time I needed to make updates or coordinate changes, it felt like a never-ending battle. I spent much time syncing updates between repositories and trying to keep everything in check. It was exhausting, and I knew there had to be a better way.\\n\\n### Simplifying Dependency Nightmares\\n\\nDependency management was another pain point for me. Dealing with different repositories meant juggling multiple sets of dependencies and version requirements. And when it came to updating dependencies, it felt like a never-ending loop of repetitive tasks. It was time-consuming and frustrating.\\n\\n### The Call for Collaboration and Code Reuse\\n\\nAs developers, we thrive on collaboration and code reuse. However, with scripts scattered across various repositories, collaboration became a daunting task. Searching for shared code felt like searching for a needle in a haystack. Code duplication crept in, leading to inconsistencies and extra maintenance work. I knew there had to be a way to streamline collaboration and maximize code reuse.\\n\\n### Embracing the Monorepo Solution\\n\\nAfter much consideration, I decided to take the plunge and combine all my independent repositories into a monorepo. And let me tell you, it was a game-changer!\\n\\n#### Harmonious Updates\\n\\nWith my scripts residing in a single monorepo, orchestrating updates became a breeze. I no longer had to manually propagate changes between repositories. I could make modifications, run tests, and validate the impact across the entire codebase with ease. Updating became a streamlined process that saved me time and reduced the risk of inconsistencies.\\n\\n#### Dependency Bliss\\n\\nThe monorepo approach revolutionized my dependency management. By centralizing all scripts, I gained better control over dependencies and versioning. I defined a shared set of dependencies and ensured compatibility across the codebase. Upgrading dependencies became a unified process, eliminating the headache of handling them separately for each repository. It made my life simpler and reduced the chances of version conflicts.\\n\\n#### Collaborative Awesomeness\\n\\nBringing all my scripts together in a monorepo unleashed a new level of collaboration and code reuse. No more jumping between repositories to find the code I needed. It was all there, easily discoverable and accessible. Code duplication became a thing of the past, streamlining maintenance and ensuring consistency across the board.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThat\'s my story of why I decided to combine multiple independent repositories into a monorepo for enhanced script management. It was a personal choice born out of the need for simplicity, efficiency, and better collaboration. While the monorepo approach may not be for everyone, it has undoubtedly transformed my development experience. If you\'re facing similar challenges, I encourage you to explore the monorepo approach and see if it\'s the right fit for you."},{"id":"/2023/06/05/_disappearing_actions","metadata":{"permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/06/05/_disappearing_actions","editUrl":"https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/edit/development/website/blog/blog/2023-06-05_disappearing_actions.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-05_disappearing_actions.md","title":"Nexus Package Manager v0.2.1 & v0.2.2: Bugfix for Disappearing Actions","description":"This bugfix release fixes the issue that makes all actions for reflexes (eg calling scripts, coloring lines etc) disappear when installing a package through the package manager.","date":"2023-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"package-manager","permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/tags/package-manager"},{"label":"release-notes","permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/tags/release-notes"}],"readingTime":0.31,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"keneanung","url":"https://github.com/keneanung","email":"keneanung@gmail.com","key":"keneanung"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"keneanung","tags":["package-manager","release-notes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"A New Home for my Nexus Repositories","permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/06/23/_a_new_home"},"nextItem":{"title":"Nexus Package Manager v0.2.0: Dependencies","permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/04/24/_dependencies"}},"content":"This bugfix release fixes the issue that makes all actions for reflexes (eg calling scripts, coloring lines etc) disappear when installing a package through the package manager.\\n\\nAdditionally, version 0.2.2 fixes an issue in the website infrastructure.\\n\\nI hope nobody lost important changes through this!\\n\\nIf you like the project, please consider leaving a star on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts) and [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/keneanung)."},{"id":"/2023/04/24/_dependencies","metadata":{"permalink":"/nexus-scripts/blog/2023/04/24/_dependencies","editUrl":"https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/edit/development/website/blog/blog/2023-04-24_dependencies.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-24_dependencies.md","title":"Nexus Package Manager v0.2.0: Dependencies","description":"I\'m happy to announce that the project reached a huge milestone.

It now handles dependencies of packages that are [listed in package repository](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-package-repository/).\\n\\n## Handling dependencies\\n\\nWhenever the package manager installs a package, it checks, whether it has other packages that are required for it to function correctly. These packages are first searched in the local package list. If they are installed, the package manager proceeds to install the original package as normal. If a dependency is not installed, the package manager will first install the dependency, before proceeding with the actual requested package installation.\\n\\nThe package manager will also make sure, that dependencies are listed in the correct order. This makes sure that the initialization of a package is only attempted when all dependencies are already initialized. No more documenting \\"and make sure package A is above package B\\". This happens both after the installation and update of a package.\\n\\n## UI improvements\\n\\nThe UI also got some improvements. You can now show package details within the window, including version, description, dependencies and a link to the website.\\n\\n![package detail view](2023-04-24_files/detail_page.png)\\n\\nThe UI main page got some layout imprvements by using icons instead of text for buttons, which makes the page much cleaner.\\n\\n![package list view](2023-04-24_files/package_listing.png)\\n\\n## Closing words\\n\\nIf these features got you interested, please feel free to either [open an issue about including your package](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-package-repository/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+package&template=new_package.yml&title=%5BPackage%5D%3A+) in the package listing or contact me on the Achaea or Nexus discrod if you need more information.
