# Packaging improvements: v0.5.0 + v0.5.1

This release does not contain any changes to the code of the event bus itself. Rather, it facilitates improvements to the packaging, adding version and website information directly into the package.

Additionally, dependencies were updated.

Version 0.5.1 contained infrastructure fixes only.

If you find bugs, would like to see more features and discuss particular design choices, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-event-bus/issues/new) to get in touch.
