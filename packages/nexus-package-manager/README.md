# Nexus Package Manager #

The original package manager for the Iron Realms Nexus 3 MUD client, written by keneanung.

# Purpose of the Package Manager #

The Iron Realms Nexus client allows players to write own reflexes that enhance gameplay by reacting to game output automatically, using shortcut commands, scripts and more. They are organized in packages and can be downloaded and shared with other players. However, there is currently no official central repository or way to discover, which public packages exist.

Some of the packages reach a greater complexity and require other packages to provide base functionality.

The package manager aims to solve these problem by using [a community based public package listing](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-package-repository/) and automating the installation and update of packages and their dependencies, all through the Nexus user interface.

# Installation #

Download [the latest version of the package manager](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-package-manager/nexusPackageManager.nxs) and install it in Nexus via the `Reflex Packages` menu option. Afterwards, a new UI tab should appear, which lets you interact with the manager.

# Usage #

After login, the package listing is empty. You can update the list by pressing the `Update Package Listing` button. For each package in the listing, you can view the package details. Installed packages can be updated and uninstalled, while packages not isntalled can be installed with the buttons.

# Including your packages in the package listing #

Please refer to [the package listing repository](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-package-repository) for more information on what packages are accepted and how to include your package.
