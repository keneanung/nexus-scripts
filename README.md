# Keneanungs Nexus Script Repository

Welcome to my repository of scripts for [Iron Realms Nexus 3 MUD client](https://play.ironrealms.com/).

This repository bundles all of my scripts into one repository, which makes it easier to orchestrate updates that span multiple packages (ie dependency updates, additionas to the Nexus typings and so on).

The packages are still available for individual download. The easiest way is to install the [Package Manager](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-scripts/nexusPackageManager.nxs) and use the UI to install further packages.

If you would like to manually install individual packages, use the `Download` link in the [Package Repository](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-package-repository), which always has the latest links. The repository also lists more packages that might be of interest.

If you would like to contribute a package or feature, have a look at [the Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
