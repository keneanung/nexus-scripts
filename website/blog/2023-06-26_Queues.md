# Queues!

This is the first release of the scripts within the new monorepo structure. For some background about the changes see [here](2023-06-23_a_new_home.md). Were're here now to celebrate the release itself! :heart:

## New Script: Queue Manager

The queue manager introduced with this release is meant to make it easier to use the in-game queueing with your scripts. It tracks the queue, allows you to queue client-side commands and tries to integrate as seamlessly as possible with external queue sources.

This release does not allow for the foll flexibility of the in-game queueing yet (like prepending or adding at certain places in the queue), but it should be enough to vet the implementation. For more details, please refer to [the documentation](https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-scripts/docs/queue-manager/).

## Developer Documentation

Due to the switch to the monorepo structure, I added a lot of additional developer documentation, like READMEs, [a Code of Conduct](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/keneanung/nexus-scripts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please have a look!

## More Infrastructure Changes

In addition to the overall layout change of the repository and all linked changes, I also switch from dependabot to [renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/). This hopefully further decreases the dependency maintenance burden as dependency upgrades are now bundled together. Currently, this still has some kinks to straighten out, but I'm sure we will get there.

## Other Changes

Most packages should now export their classes as a global library, which webpack then can use to avoid bundling all the code with yours. This is still untested, so expect further changes in that area.

Additionally, quite a few of the linter and test rules saw some harmonization, which prompted a few non-code changes to follow best practices.
