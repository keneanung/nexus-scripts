Test, test... Is this thing on? Aehm...

Since the infrastructure seems to be up and running, it is time to tell you why we moved.

## Why I Combined Multiple Independent Repositories into a Monorepo for Enhanced Script Management

Today, I want to share my personal journey of merging multiple independent repositories into a monorepo for better script management. It's not about convincing you that monorepos are the holy grail, but rather about sharing why I made this decision and the benefits I experienced. So, let's dive in!

### Tired of Update Chaos

I used to manage my scripts across different repositories. Every time I needed to make updates or coordinate changes, it felt like a never-ending battle. I spent much time syncing updates between repositories and trying to keep everything in check. It was exhausting, and I knew there had to be a better way.

### Simplifying Dependency Nightmares

Dependency management was another pain point for me. Dealing with different repositories meant juggling multiple sets of dependencies and version requirements. And when it came to updating dependencies, it felt like a never-ending loop of repetitive tasks. It was time-consuming and frustrating.

### The Call for Collaboration and Code Reuse

As developers, we thrive on collaboration and code reuse. However, with scripts scattered across various repositories, collaboration became a daunting task. Searching for shared code felt like searching for a needle in a haystack. Code duplication crept in, leading to inconsistencies and extra maintenance work. I knew there had to be a way to streamline collaboration and maximize code reuse.

### Embracing the Monorepo Solution

After much consideration, I decided to take the plunge and combine all my independent repositories into a monorepo. And let me tell you, it was a game-changer!

#### Harmonious Updates

With my scripts residing in a single monorepo, orchestrating updates became a breeze. I no longer had to manually propagate changes between repositories. I could make modifications, run tests, and validate the impact across the entire codebase with ease. Updating became a streamlined process that saved me time and reduced the risk of inconsistencies.

#### Dependency Bliss

The monorepo approach revolutionized my dependency management. By centralizing all scripts, I gained better control over dependencies and versioning. I defined a shared set of dependencies and ensured compatibility across the codebase. Upgrading dependencies became a unified process, eliminating the headache of handling them separately for each repository. It made my life simpler and reduced the chances of version conflicts.

#### Collaborative Awesomeness

Bringing all my scripts together in a monorepo unleashed a new level of collaboration and code reuse. No more jumping between repositories to find the code I needed. It was all there, easily discoverable and accessible. Code duplication became a thing of the past, streamlining maintenance and ensuring consistency across the board.

### Conclusion

That's my story of why I decided to combine multiple independent repositories into a monorepo for enhanced script management. It was a personal choice born out of the need for simplicity, efficiency, and better collaboration. While the monorepo approach may not be for everyone, it has undoubtedly transformed my development experience. If you're facing similar challenges, I encourage you to explore the monorepo approach and see if it's the right fit for you.
