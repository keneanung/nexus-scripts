Welcome to the documentation of the EventBus package for the IRE Nexus client.

The package is meant as a tool for developers to help them implement the publish-subscriber pattern. This is especially useful if a source supplies events to dependent code and this dependent code is only known at runtime.

This documentation describes the usage of the package and offers some best practices to look out for.
