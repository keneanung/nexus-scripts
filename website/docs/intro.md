# Documentation for Keneanungs Nexus Scripts

Welcome to the documentation of Keneanungs Nexus scripts. Here you can find information on the different packages and their usage. Please see the individual sections on each.

If you find a typo or feel the documentation leaves open questions, please use the edit link at the end of each page to improve the document for the next who comes along. Remember the boy scout rule:

> Try and leave this world a little better than you found it.
>
> - Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell

Or as Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) put it:

> Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
